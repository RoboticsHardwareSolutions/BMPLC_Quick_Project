# RPLC Quick Project
The RPLC Quick Project is a development environment for Robotics Hardware Solutions (RHS) that integrates various third-party libraries and tools to streamline embedded system development. It includes support for FreeRTOS, CMSIS, STM32 HAL, and other components.

# Key Components
### FreeRTOS

Real-time operating system kernel for embedded devices.
Repository structure and kernel features are detailed in the FreeRTOS README.
### CMSIS

Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard.
Includes CMSIS-DSP, CMSIS-NN, and CMSIS-RTOS RTX.
Documentation and tools are available in the CMSIS README.
### STM32 HAL and CMSIS

Hardware Abstraction Layer and CMSIS for STM32 microcontrollers.
Release notes and compatibility information are provided in the respective STM32F1 CMSIS README and STM32F7 CMSIS README.
### RHS Bare Metal Core

Core library for RHS projects.
Instructions for integration are in the RHS README.
### RTT (Real-Time Transfer)

SEGGER RTT for real-time debugging and data transfer.
Details are in the RTT README.
